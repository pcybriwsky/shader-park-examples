# ShaderPark Vite Prebuild Plugin Template ðŸŽ‰



This setup uses a Vite plugin to generate the GLSL shaders at build time, so the shader-park-core library does not need to be bundled into your app. This has several benefits:
- Smaller bundle size. shader-park-core is heavy because it depends on large libraries like esprima.
- Faster initial render. Shaders are generated ahead of time.
- No need to use eval in the browser. This is more secure and follows best practices.
- Clear isolation between shaderpark code and the rest of your javascript code.
- Live editing and hot-reloading still works when developling locally.

Write your Shader Park code in the spCode.sp file.  
You can simply paste in code from the ShaderPark web editor!
